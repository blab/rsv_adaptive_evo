Job 4: 
        Aligning sequences to config/rsv_reference.fasta
            - gaps relative to reference are considered real
        

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 66 of /Users/katekistler/nextstrain/rsv_testing/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/translations/aligned_A.gene.N.fasta
results/translations/aligned_A.gene.P.fasta
results/translations/aligned_A.gene.M.fasta
results/translations/aligned_A.gene.SH.fasta
results/translations/aligned_A.gene.G.fasta
results/translations/aligned_A.gene.F.fasta
results/translations/aligned_A.gene.M2.fasta
results/translations/aligned_A.gene.L.fasta
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 4 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 4
Removing output files of failed job align since they might be corrupted:
results/aligned_A.fasta, results/insertions_A.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
